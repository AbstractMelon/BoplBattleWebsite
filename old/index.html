      <p>Bopl battle is a multiplayer couch/online game where you battle your friends with unique and wild abilities. There are many choices such as a shrink ray, creating black holes, stopping time and attaching a rocket engine to the stage to send it flying. Choose a combination that synergizes well to win the round.</p>
      <p>Squish and splatter each other in a last slime standing battle!</p>
      <h2>Things you can do in the game:</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Attach a rocket engine to platforms to send them flying away</li>
          <li>Cover the stage in flammable smoke</li>
          <li>Create a black hole and make it swallow the whole stage</li>
          <li>Use a growth ray to temporarily enlarge anything, including arrows, grenades, other players, even the stage itself</li>
          <li>Stop time and setup a deadly situation for all of your enemies as they are frozen</li>
          <li>Grab the stage and move it around</li>
          <li>Invent your own strategy with a unique ability combination</li>
          <li>Create platform + control platform + attach big sword onto platform</li>
          <li>Flammable smoke + throw grenade + turn into an invincible rock</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The combos get even wilder in the team vs team mode, as you cooperate with someone to really push the game to its limit.</p>
      <!-- <p>I've created the game almost entirely by myself including programming, art, animation and game design. The exceptions being the music, which I commissioned Jupiter V for, as well as the sound effects which are licensed stock effects.</p> -->
